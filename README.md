# SubjectChangeRequestSystemSQL
Designed a Stored Procedure to manage subject change requests by students with full historical tracking.

Key functionalities included:
âœ… Checking if the new subject is different from the currently allotted subject
âœ… Marking the previous subject as inactive (Is_Valid = 0)
âœ… Inserting the new subject as valid (Is_Valid = 1)
âœ… Handling new requests for students with no prior allotment

ðŸ“Š Tables Used:

SubjectAllotments â€“ Stores current & previous subject mappings

SubjectRequest â€“ Stores new subject requests

The solution involved writing precise SQL logic and ensuring data consistency while preserving history, using CTEs to make the workflow cleaner and more efficient.
